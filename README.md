# DIU.Atomic.Fusion.Menu

This fusion menu is based on the default Neos.Neos:Menu with the exception that this does not use the Neos.Fusion:Template. Instead it uses the idea of atomic fusion.

This package should help you, if you need an easy and fast to implement default menu, like from Neos.Neos:Menu but without the need of an HTML template
